# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policies, procedures, and best practices for the Swiss Army Knife (SAK) custom card project.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

### Security Principles

1. **Security by Design**: Security considerations are integrated into every aspect of development
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
