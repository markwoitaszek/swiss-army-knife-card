## 🔄 Branch Management Strategy

### Systematic Implementation Process

#### 1. **Issue Analysis & Planning**

For each issue:

- Create feature branch from `phase-5-uat-review`
- Analyze requirements and create detailed implementation plan
- Identify dependencies and potential risks
- Set up testing strategy

#### 2. **Implementation & Testing**

- Execute implementation systematically
- Write comprehensive tests for all new code
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document all changes

#### 3. **Quality Assurance**

- Run full test suite
- Perform code quality checks
- Validate performance impact
- Test integration with existing code

#### 4. **Pull Request & Integration**

- Create PR against `phase-5-uat-review`
- Code review and approval
- Merge to phase branch
- Clean up feature branch

#### 5. **Next Issue Preparation**

- Update phase branch with latest changes
- Create new feature branch for next issue
- Ensure clean separation of concerns
